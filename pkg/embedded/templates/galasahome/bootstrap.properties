# 
# File: bootstrap.properties
#
# Purpose:
#   To provide properties required to customise the boot-up 
#   sequence of a Galasa run-time.
#
# Supported properties:
# 
# framework.config.store - Refer this to the URI of where the Configuration Property Store is located.
#   The GALASA_CONFIG_STORE environment variable can override this value.
#   If neither are set, then it defaults to file:///${GALASA_HOME}/cps.properties 
#   (GALASA_HOME will default to the current users' home folder if not explicitly set as an 
#   environment variable).
#   If the file does not exist already, then the Galasa framework will try to create any empty file.
