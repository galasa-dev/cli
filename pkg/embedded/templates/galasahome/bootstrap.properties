# 
# File: bootstrap.properties
#
# Purpose:
#   To provide properties required to customise the boot-up 
#   sequence of a Galasa run-time.
#
# Supported properties:
# 
# framework.config.store - Refer this to the URI of where the Configuration Property Store is located.
#   The GALASA_CONFIG_STORE environment variable can override this value.
#   If neither are set, then it defaults to file:///${GALASA_HOME}/cps.properties 
#   (GALASA_HOME will default to the current users' home folder if not explicitly set as an 
#   environment variable).
#   If the file does not exist already, then the Galasa framework will try to create any empty file.
#
# galasactl.jvm.local.launch.options - Add a space-separated string which contains all the extra options
#   you want added to a command which launches the JVM to run a test in that local JVM.
#   For example:
#   framework.jvm.local.launch.options=-Xmx80m
#   or
#   framework.jvm.local.launch.options=-Xmx80m -Xms20m
#
# galasactl.jvm.local.launch.debug.mode - Only used when the --debug flag is used on launching a test 
#   within a local JVM. 
#   When the JVM connects to a Java Debugger, should it :
#   'listen' on the debug port, waiting for the java debugger to connect,
#   or
#   'attach' to the debug port, which already has the java debugger set up.
#   Defaults to 'listen' if the value is neither set on the command-line or in the bootstrap properties.
#
# galasactl.jvm.local.launch.debug.port - Only used when the --debug flag is used on launching a test 
#   within a local JVM. 
#   A unsigned integer value, says which port will be used when the testcase JVM connects to a Java Debugger.
#   Can be overridden using the --debugPort parameter on the 'galasactl runs submit local' command.
#   Defaults to 2970 if the value is neither set on the command-line or in the bootstrap properties.
